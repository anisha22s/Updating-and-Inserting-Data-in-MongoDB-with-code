# Updating-and-Inserting-Data-in-MongoDB-with-code
Code includes  Webscraping to parse shop information for top 30 “Pizzeria” in San Francisco on Yellow Pages.
Extracted shop information is then stored into a MongoDB collection, one document for each shop.
#Using API from  https://positionstack.com/, we modify our MongoDB collection to add lattitude and longitude information to each shop.
